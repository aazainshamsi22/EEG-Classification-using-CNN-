## Project Details
👨‍💻 This project is built with Python.  

## Dataset used: 
### Note  :   
Dataset is uploaded at my drive. Here is the link:

It contains 9 subjects and 4 classes at which the data is based. 

## Getting Started 🏁  
To run this project on your local machine, you need to have Python 3.8 or higher installed. Follow the steps below to get started:  

## Detailed Explaination
1. In this course project, I have arranged, preprocessed, and normalized the 4 classes (basically 4 movements) present in dataset. After that I have converted the dataset into .npy format from .mat format. Also checkout the original dataset file on this given link here:

2. Then I have applied Convulotional Neural Networks (CNN) model to the dataset and run the model on different epochs for every subject. 

3. Our main goal is to find every subject's accuracy on multi-class classification.
